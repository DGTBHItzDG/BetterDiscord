## What does it do?
- MobileCord's main goal is to try and mimmick the look and feel of the Mobile Discord client to make Discord seem more "uniform" across all devices.
- MobileCord also incorporates the hidden AMOLED feature from Mobile Discord right into your Desktop, to provide a clean UI.
- There is also a new User Profile that is a hybrid of both the Desktop and Mobile client.

## Side note: 

I'd just like to say, any user feedback and/or help is welcome as this may turn into a long-term Discord UI revamp and I am far from perfect as a 1 man team.
